## Development

Just run `yarn start`.

## Production

Run `yarn build`. The generated files will be on the `build` folder.

## My view on task
I had to create:
- Coordinate system with relative points of measure abstracted from strict width and height
- Bars chart with high customization opportunities and simple yet powerful API

## Was it hard?
- YES IT WAS

## Am I proud of my work?
- **100%**
- Enjoy.
